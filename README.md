# Intro
This project interfaces with the [Esports Program Master List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jf1ARsXEpiTPVXfrheZZ045ZiiThfl8WCwyWcdglldY/edit#gid=0) organized by [Sheridan](https://twitter.com/cutiepebbs). The goal is to be able to refence the branding of any colligate esports program to automate content elements for universities. Currently this is a demo of what's possible given the status of the master list. Eventually this project could be turned into an API to integrate with other softwares.
